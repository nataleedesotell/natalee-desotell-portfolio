They're bakers (as mentioned in <a href = https://nataleedesotell.github.io/resumap.html">my resumap</a>) and they sell at two farmer's markets in Madison, Wisconsin. Their website needed a facelift, so I created a new one using Boostrap and HTML/CSS. I also created custom maps for their homepage and both market pages using Adobe Illustrator.</p>

					 I created this map as a final project for my first cartography course ever. I wanted to
					 try my hand at a cartogram because it's an interesting way to visualize information. I chose this topic because my parents have sold at the Dane County Farmer's Market since I was 5 years old, so it's a big part of my life. I was interested in exploring accessibility to markets
					 for low income families.</p>

The assignment was to conceive of a fictional bike tour and show the route clearly over relief and landcover data. I chose to focus on India because I studied Hindi in college and was lucky enough to study abroad there in 2013. The original plan was to do the map in Hindi, but that proved to be a more difficult task than I could take on before the deadline. I may go back someday and create a Hindi version.</p>
