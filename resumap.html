        <h3>Hey, there! I'm Natalee</h3>
         <br>
        <p> I like to <br> a) think spatially, <br> b) create pretty things, and <br> c) play with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br> In case you're interested in learning more about me than I could fit on <a href = "nataleedesotell.github.io/resume.pdf"> my resume </a>, I created this resumap to provide a little more context. You won't find lists of degrees or skills here, but you will learn a little more about who I am.  </p>

        <h3>Yeah, I know the muffin man.</h3>
        <p>I grew up in a tiny town in Wisconsin where my parents own a wholesale bakery. I started working there by cracking eggs at age five. From middle school until I left Wisconsin in 2017, I helped them sell their products at the local farmer's market.  <br><br> Even though I live 1,033 miles away, now, I still found a way to contribute; I built them a <a href = "http://chrisandlorisbakehouse.com/"> new website</a> in April 2018 using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, and GitHub pages. You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/chrisandlorisbakehouse/chrisandlorisbakehouse.github.io/tree/master">here</a>.

        <h3>Off to College</h3>
        <p>My first year of college was in Milwaukee. This is where I volunteered with an organization to end human trafficking, which opened my eyes to all the factors that can contribute to and alleviate human suffering. I started to turn my academic focus towards population health, economics, and social justice issues. </p>
    </section>
    <section id='uwmad'>
        <h3>Badger for life.</h3>
        <p>
        After a year in Milwaukee, I transferred to UW-Madison. I got more involved with social justice groups, like WISPIRG, and even got a chance to develop and lead my own organization: "Just Food". I got my first taste of leadership as I oversaw twenty interns. I coached them through coalition building and lobbying campus officialls to increase their fair trade and local food products in the food halls. 
        </br></br>
        I bounced around between majors for awhile, and I landed on three: International Studies, Political Science, and Languages & Cultures of Asia.

        <h3>Study Abroad, Summer 2013</h3>
        <p>I spent my last semester as a UW-Madison student in India, where I interned at a health microinsurance organization called Parvati Swayamrojgar Yojana. For my internship, I spent my days interviewing participants of the microinsurance program to learn how they perceived their access to healthcare. At the end of the summer, I provided a summary of findings to the directors of the program.

        <h3>Wedding Bells</h3>
        <p>About a month after I returned from India, I married the love of my life in a surprise wedding ceremony. The wedding was in a barn near our shared hometown.

    <section id='uwcu'>
        <h3>Working World: UW Credit Union</h3>
        <p> For about two years after graduating from college, I worked as a teller at UW Credit Union. While there, I helped to train new employees, held the responsibility of being "vault teller" (i.e., balancing the vault of cash every night), and I met some people who became my best friends. I knew all along that finance wasn't my long-term career goal, but I wouldn't trade my time at UW Credit Union for anything.

    <section id='giswmp'>
        <h3>GIS Certificate and Master's Program</h3>
        <p>
        From UW Credit Union, I moved just a few blocks to the west and began a program to learn GIS and Cartography at UW-Madison. I saw GIS as a way to make myself marketable in the public health field (I also thought maps were really cool). <br><br> Becoming a part of the UW-Madison Geography family was one of the best choices I've ever made. Not only did I meet some incredible people, but I learned so much more than I bargained for. Now I have programming, web design, graphic design, and geostatistical methods in my toolbox. These skills inform how I approach my public health schooling at Yale and how I will approach my career as an infectious disease epidemiologist.

        <h3>Off to New Haven</h3>
        <p>
            
        In 2017, my husband and I packed up our belongings and headed out east for New Haven. While he's working in the Pharmacology Department on West Campus, I'm on the Medical Campus learning the ins and outs of infectious disease immunology, genetics, and biology. It's quite a departure from my earlier coursework, but I'm enjoying the challenge.
