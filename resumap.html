        <h3>Hey, there! I'm Natalee</h3>
         <br>
        <p> I like to <br> a) think spatially, <br> b) create pretty things, and <br> c) play with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br> It made sense to create little 'resumap' to accompany my static resume. This fills in some gaps in my resume, like where I come from and what I'm about. It includes some details about my favorite travels and important "aha" moments in my life.</p>

        <h3>Yeah, I know the muffin man.</h3>
        <p>I grew up in a tiny town in Wisconsin where my parents own a wholesale bakery. I started there by cracking eggs at age five. From middle school until I left Wisconsin in 2017, I helped them sell their products at the local farmer's market. Even though I live 1,033 miles away, now, I still found a way to contribute; I built them a <a href = "http://chrisandlorisbakehouse.com/"> new website</a> in April 2018. It utilizes HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap and is hosted using GitHub pages. You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/chrisandlorisbakehouse/chrisandlorisbakehouse.github.io/tree/master">here</a>.

        <h3>Off to College</h3>
        <p>My first year of college was in Milwaukee back in 2008. This is where I volunteered with an organization to end human trafficking, which opened my eyes to all the factors that can contribute to and dismantle human suffering. I started to turn my focus towards population health, economics, and social justice issues. </p>

        <h3>Badger for life.</h3>
        <p>
            
        After a year in Milwaukee, I transferred to UW-Madison. I got more involved with social justice groups, like WISPIRG, and even got a chance to develop and lead my own organization "Just Food" under the WISPIRG umbrella. I got my first taste of leadership as a oversaw twenty interns in coalition building and lobbying campus to increase their fair trade and local food products in the food halls. 
        </br></br>
        I bounced around between majors for awhile, and I landed on three: International Studies, Political Science, and Languages & Cultures of Asia. I loved the International Studies major because of its focus on international political economy; I still like to get nerdy over supply and demand graphs! Political Science fascinated me.

        <h3>Working World: UW Credit Union</h3>
        <p> For about two years after graduating from college, I worked as a teller at UW Credit Union. While there, I helped to train new employees, held the responsibility of being "vault teller" (i.e., balancing the vault of cash every night), and I met people who became my best friends. I knew finance wasn't my long term career goal and was still looking out for public health-related opportunities, but I wouldn't trade my time at UW Credit Union for anything.

        <h3>GIS Certificate and Master's Program</h3>
        <p>
        From UW Credit Union, I moved just a few blocks to the west and began a program to learn GIS and Cartography. I started the program with little knowledge of what GIS was, aside from that it's a) making maps, and b) is important for public health. I saw GIS as a way to make myself marketable in the public health field, but I also just thought maps were really cool. It's one of the best choices I've ever made in my life, because completing the GIS Certificate and the MS in GIS and Web Map Programming gave me some web design and programming skills that I love using and that set me apart from other people in public health.
